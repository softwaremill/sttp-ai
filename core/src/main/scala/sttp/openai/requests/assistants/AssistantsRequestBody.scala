  /** @param model
    *   ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for
    *   descriptions of them.
    * @param name
    *   The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.
    * @param description
    *   The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.
    * @param instructions
    *   The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 32768 characters.
    * @param reasoningEffort
    *   o1 and o3-mini models only Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values are low, medium, and
    *   high. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.
    * @param tools
    *   A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types code_interpreter,
    *   file_search, or function.
    * @param toolResources
    *   A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the
    *   code_interpreter tool requires a list of file IDs, while the file_search tool requires a list of vector store IDs.
    * @param metadata
    *   Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object
    *   in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.
    * @param temperature
    *   What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like
    *   0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
    * @param topP
    *   An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p
    *   probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend
    *   altering this or temperature but not both.
